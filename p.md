**4. User Personas & Scenarios**

*   **4.1. Primary Persona(s)**
    *   **Sam the Social Media Manager:** Manages multiple client accounts on Twitter and LinkedIn. Needs to respond quickly and professionally to comments and mentions throughout the day. Values efficiency and maintaining a consistent brand voice.
    *   **Chloe the Content Creator:** Active on Reddit and Twitter, engaging with her community. Wants to reply thoughtfully but struggles with writer's block or finding witty responses quickly. Values authentic-sounding engagement.

*   **4.2. Key User Scenarios / Use Cases**
    *   **Scenario 1 (LinkedIn):** Sam sees a comment on a client's LinkedIn post. Clicks the "AI Reply" button, selects "Professional" tone, reviews the suggestions, clicks one, and the reply text appears in the LinkedIn comment box, ready to send.
    *   **Scenario 2 (Twitter):** Chloe reads a funny reply to her Tweet. Clicks "AI Reply", selects "Witty" tone, picks the best suggestion, and pastes it into the Twitter reply field.
    *   **Scenario 3 (Reddit):** A user encounters a supportive comment in a subreddit thread. They click "AI Reply", keep the default "Friendly" tone, choose a suitable suggestion, and paste it to continue the positive interaction.
    *   **Scenario 4 (Error Handling):** A user clicks "AI Reply", but the Gemini API is temporarily down. The popup displays a message like "Sorry, couldn't generate replies right now. Please try again."

**5. User Stories**
_(Illustrative - AI Agent should ensure all functional requirements below are covered)_

*   **US1:** As a Social Media Manager, I want to see an "AI Reply" button next to comments on LinkedIn so that I can quickly generate replies.
*   **US2:** As a Content Creator, I want to select a "Witty" tone for my Twitter replies so that my engagement matches my online persona.
*   **US3:** As any user, I want to click on a generated suggestion and have it automatically pasted into the reply box so that I don't have to manually copy and paste.
*   **US4:** As a user on Reddit, I want the extension to correctly identify the comment I want to reply to, even in nested threads.
*   **US5:** As a user, I want the AI to generate 3 distinct reply options so I can choose the one that fits best.
*   **US6:** As a user, I want the extension's UI to be unobtrusive and match the look and feel of the platform I'm using.
*   **US7:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want assurance that my data and the content I interact with are not stored long-term.

**6. Functional Requirements (FR)**

*   **6.1. Extension Core & UI**
    *   **FR1.1:** The extension MUST be built using Manifest V3 for Google Chrome.
    *   **FR1.2:** The extension MUST inject a small, clickable "ðŸ’¬ AI Reply" icon button adjacent to detectable post/comment elements on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Reddit feeds and post pages.
        *   **FR1.2.1:** Injection logic MUST be robust against minor UI changes on the platforms (use stable selectors where possible). Platform-specific content scripts (`x.js`, `linkedin.js`, `reddit.js`) MUST handle this.
    *   **FR1.3:** Clicking the "AI Reply" button MUST open an inline popup/widget near the button.
    *   **FR1.4:** The popup MUST contain a dropdown or similar UI element to select the reply tone.
        *   **FR1.4.1:** Available tones MUST be: Friendly (Default), Professional, Witty, Supportive, Sarcastic.
    *   **FR1.5:** The popup MUST display a list area for the AI-generated reply suggestions (maximum 3).
    *   **FR1.6:** Clicking on a generated suggestion MUST trigger the `paste-reply` action.
    *   **FR1.7:** The extension MUST include a background script (`background.js`) to manage communication between content scripts and the backend, potentially acting as a message broker.
    *   **FR1.8:** The extension MUST include basic UI styling (`popup.css`) ensuring a clean, minimal, modern look that doesn't clash significantly with platform UIs.
    *   **FR1.9:** The extension MUST include a mechanism (e.g., a link in the popup or an options page) for users to provide feedback (leading to an email address or feedback form URL provided later).

*   **6.2. Content Interaction & Parsing**
    *   **FR2.1:** Content scripts MUST accurately identify and extract the text content of the parent post/comment associated with the clicked "AI Reply" button.
    *   **FR2.2:** Content scripts MUST identify the target reply input field associated with the post/comment.
    *   **FR2.3:** When a suggestion is clicked (`paste-reply` action), the content script MUST accurately paste the suggestion text into the correct reply input field on the page.

*   **6.3. Backend API & AI Integration**
    *   **FR3.1:** A backend service MUST be created using Node.js and Express.js.
    *   **FR3.2:** The backend MUST expose a secure HTTPS endpoint (e.g., `/generate-reply`) that accepts POST requests.
    *   **FR3.3:** The `/generate-reply` endpoint MUST accept the post/comment text and the selected tone as input parameters in the request body (e.g., JSON: `{ "postText": "...", "tone": "Friendly", "platform": "Twitter" }`). (Platform might be useful for context).
    *   **FR3.4:** The backend MUST securely store and use the Gemini API key (using environment variables, e.g., `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`). The key MUST NOT be exposed to the frontend/extension.
    *   **FR3.5:** The backend MUST use the provided Gemini API integration code structure (using `@google/genai`, `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` model, streaming preferred if suitable, otherwise single generation) to generate replies.
        *   **FR3.5.1:** The AI prompt MUST be dynamically constructed based on the input text, selected tone, and potentially the platform, following the format:
            ```txt
            You are an assistant helping users respond to social media posts.
            Generate 3 distinct replies in a [TONE] tone to the following [PLATFORM] post:

            [POST TEXT]

            Replies:
            1. [Reply 1]
            2. [Reply 2]
            3. [Reply 3]
            ```
            (Backend should parse the 3 replies from the AI output).
    *   **FR3.6:** The backend MUST return the generated reply suggestions (up to 3) in a structured format (e.g., JSON: `{ "suggestions": ["reply1", "reply2", "reply3"] }`) to the extension.
    *   **FR3.7:** The backend MUST be stateless regarding user data and request history. Only temporary, anonymized logging for debugging purposes is permitted.
    *   **FR3.8:** The backend MUST handle potential errors during API calls to Gemini (e.g., timeouts, API errors) and return appropriate error responses to the extension.

*   **6.4. Error Handling (User Facing)**
    *   **FR4.1:** If the extension cannot parse the post/comment text, the "AI Reply" button SHOULD NOT appear, or if clicked, display an error message within the popup (e.g., "Could not read post content").
    *   **FR4.2:** If the backend API call fails (e.g., Gemini error, network issue), the popup MUST display a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Failed to generate replies. Please try again.").
    *   **FR4.3:** If pasting the reply fails, provide visual feedback or a console error (less critical, as pasting is usually reliable).

**7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

*   **7.1. Performance**
    *   **NFR1.1:** Reply suggestions should be generated and displayed within 3-5 seconds of the user selecting a tone (dependent on Gemini API speed).
    *   **NFR1.2:** The extension's content scripts MUST NOT noticeably degrade the performance or responsiveness of the host social media pages. Use efficient DOM selectors and avoid heavy computations on the main thread.
    *   **NFR1.3:** Backend API response time (excluding AI generation time) should be under 500ms.

*   **7.2. Scalability**
    *   **NFR2.1:** The backend architecture MUST be stateless to allow for easy horizontal scaling if usage increases significantly.
    *   **NFR2.2:** Content script injection logic should be designed to minimize breakage from minor platform UI updates (e.g., prefer data attributes over complex CSS paths if available).

*   **7.3. Usability**
    *   **NFR3.1:** The "AI Reply" button and popup UI MUST be intuitive and require minimal learning.
    *   **NFR3.2:** The extension's UI elements MUST NOT obstruct critical platform features.
    *   **NFR3.3:** The process of generating and using a reply should feel seamless and integrated.

*   **7.4. Reliability / Availability**
    *   **NFR4.1:** The extension MUST function reliably on the latest stable version of Google Chrome.
    *   **NFR4.2:** The backend service should aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime), typically managed via the hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Render, AWS Lambda). Graceful handling of Gemini API downtime is required (see FR4.2).

*   **7.5. Security**
    *   **NFR5.1:** The Gemini API key MUST be kept confidential and securely stored on the backend, inaccessible from the frontend extension code.
    *   **NFR5.2:** All communication between the extension and the backend MUST use HTTPS.
    *   **NFR5.3:** The extension MUST request only the minimum necessary permissions in `manifest.json`.
    *   **NFR5.4:** Input sanitization should be considered on the backend if user-generated content were ever used in prompts in ways that could be exploitable (less critical here as input is post text, but good practice).

*   **7.6. Accessibility**
    *   **NFR6.1:** UI elements added by the extension (button, popup) SHOULD aim for basic accessibility compliance (e.g., keyboard navigability, sufficient color contrast, ARIA attributes if necessary).

*   **7.7. Maintainability**
    *   **NFR7.1:** Code MUST be well-documented with comments explaining complex logic.
    *   **NFR7.2:** Code MUST follow consistent coding standards (e.g., ESLint/Prettier configured).
    *   **NFR7.3:** The project structure MUST be modular as specified (separate `extension/` and `backend/` folders with clear subdirectories).
    *   **NFR7.4:** Configuration (like API endpoints) should be easily manageable.

**8. UI/UX Requirements & Design**

*   **8.1. Wireframes / Mockups**
    *   No specific wireframes provided. The AI agent should propose a UI based on the following principles.

*   **8.2. Key UI Elements**
    *   **AI Reply Button:** Small, visually distinct but unobtrusive icon (e.g., "ðŸ’¬") placed consistently near post/comment elements.
    *   **Inline Popup:** Appears on button click. Contains:
        *   Tone Selector: Dropdown or pills/buttons.
        *   Suggestion Area: Displays 1-3 text suggestions, clearly separated and clickable.
        *   Loading Indicator: Shown while waiting for backend response.
        *   Error Message Area: Displays errors if generation fails.
        *   Feedback Link (Optional but Recommended): Small, non-intrusive link.

*   **8.3. User Flow Diagrams**
    *   **Flow 1: Generate & Paste Reply**
        1.  User sees post/comment on supported platform.
        2.  User clicks "ðŸ’¬ AI Reply" button.
