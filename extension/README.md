## Development

### Content Scripts

The extension uses content scripts to inject the "AI Reply" button into the DOM of supported platforms:

- `twitter.js`: Handles Twitter/X integration
- `linkedin.js`: Handles LinkedIn integration
- `reddit.js`: Handles Reddit integration

Each content script is responsible for:
1. Identifying posts/comments
2. Injecting the "AI Reply" button
3. Extracting post text
4. Displaying the tone selector
5. Displaying reply suggestions
6. Pasting the selected reply into the comment field

### Background Script

The background script (`background.js`) handles communication between content scripts and the backend API. It:

1. Receives messages from content scripts
2. Makes API calls to the backend
3. Returns the generated replies to the content scripts

### UI Components

The extension includes several UI components:
- `popup.html`: The main popup that appears when clicking the extension icon
- `tone-selector.html`: The tone selection UI
- `suggestion-box.html`: The UI for displaying generated reply suggestions

## Configuration

The extension can be configured to use a different backend API endpoint by setting the `apiBaseUrl` in chrome.storage.local.
